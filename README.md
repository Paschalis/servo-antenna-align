# servo-antenna-align
A system to optimize Wi-Fi signal strength for video transmission by rotating a directional antenna using a servo motor. Supports Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and Radxa Zero 3W with GPIO libraries (wiringPi for Raspberry Pi and libgpiod for Radxa). Ideal for UAV video streaming, it ensures automatic antenna alignment with the strongest signal.
